Lightning makes coding complex networks simple.
It is not a high level framework like `keras`, but forces a neat code organization and encapsulation.

You should be somewhat familiar with PyTorch and [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) before using this template.
