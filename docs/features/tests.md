# Tests

The generated project includes automated tests that use the **current configuration** defined in your project.

You should write additional tests specific to each project, but running the tests should give an
idea at least if the code and fundamental operations work as expected.


!!! info

    You can execute the tests with:

    ```bash
    pytest -v
    ```
